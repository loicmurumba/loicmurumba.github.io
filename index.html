I'm an engineering student with a passion for programming and design, and I'm currently looking for a co-op position for the upcoming fall term. I made this website to expand my javascript, HTML, and jquery; I hope you enjoy it!

						<h4>Personal Website</h4>
						<p class="projdesc">The website you're currently browsing! I learned a lot about design in the process and used CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQuery to bring this to life. It took a few weeks and quite a bit of trial and error to get every detail working; hopefully you're enjoying it! You can view the code on github here.

I created this with the help of a few students at a hackathon and learned a lot about to use android studio. You can view the code on github here.

						<h4>Quick Pic</h4>
						<p class="projdesc">A chrome extension that reduces the image load time on websites your browser visits by sending them to an external server before they're loaded. The server would then lower the image resolution and send it back to your browser for a faster experience. I learned a lot more about node.js and some javascript functions while working on this!
