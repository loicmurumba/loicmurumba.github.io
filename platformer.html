      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This project was definitely one of my most difficult to execute, but I think the 
        hardest part was learning how to use the phaser game library effectively. I'd spent
        a long time looking at implementations of genetic algorithms and learning how they 
        work, but practically no time developing games with Phaser.
      </br> </br>
        Getting assets and sprites that I could be satisfied with was also pretty difficult;
        I went through a few different themes before settling with the current one.

      <h2>Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Before this project, machine learning had always seemed like a huge and complex concept 
        that only a few people could manipulate successfully. I learned that fundamentally, machine
        learning is just some simple calculus and math that leverages a computers ability to grind 
        calculations quickly; no magic involved. Although this project was very simple, I plan on 
        developing a larger scale ML project sometime soon.
