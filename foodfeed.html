        To complete this project, I enlisted the help of a good friend of mine 
        who has a lot of iOS development experience, and another friend that works
        as a UI/UX designer. We think our combined strengths can make a very intuitive
        and simple product, and hope our app will gain popularity through this.
      </p>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I took on this project to improve my Android development skills, and to get a 
        preview of what iOS development is like. We're aiming to release the app in early 
        december, and we're hoping the app gains some traction online once published.
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Working in a team requires a lot of coordination and communication, which is 
        difficult when faced with busy schedules and other obligations. Despite this
        challenge, we're working well and making sure everyone's opinion is respected 
        and considered. The small team size has definitely helped maintain this process.
        </br> </br>
        With food feed, I want to learn from the mistakes I made with 
        <a href="soar.html" class="color2 text-link">
          my last android app
        </a>
        . Because of this, I've been working carefully to make sure I dont fall
        into the same bad habits. The biggest challenge so far has been 
        keeping my code hack-free and completely granular, since I need to 
        learn a lot of conventions in Android to make sure I pull this off properly.
     
      </p>
      <h2>Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        The project isn't yet complete, but I've definitely learned a lot already
        through it already. Maintaining a good codebase is a lot easier than
         refactoring a bad one. Also, a designer is <em>incredibly</em> valuable.
