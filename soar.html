      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>I started developing the mobile game last winter with no experience in 
        android or even Git, and it was my first full project. Before Soar, I'd 
        only coded for school assignments and small projects but I came to learn 
        that making a project on your own involves a completely different 
        process. There was no teacher to guide me when I got confused, so I had 
        to find my own solutions. I got into the pattern of googling and 
        using youtube videos effectively to make my game, and I learned to 
        enjoy it. 
      </br> </br>
        The other big challenge was organizing the assets and correctly designing 
        the animations. Perfecting sprites and background images took hours longer 
        than I predicted. When I started developing, I hadn't considered all the 
        resources I could have used to save time, which is what led to this mistake.
      </p>
      <h2>Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Time management, organization, and code clarity are key. Hours spent 
        debugging weird code could have been spent breaking down the tasks into 
        more manageable pieces first. Since I didn't have any actual experience 
        outside of easy little coding projects, I thought I could develop the 
        whole thing without much planning (<em>big</em> mistake). As a first project, 
        I'm satisfied with what I managed to complete, but I'll always cringe a
        little when I think back to how I took on this project.
