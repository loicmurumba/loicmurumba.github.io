      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        When I started developing this game last year, I only had dev experience with static web
        pages and a touch of mobile. A big motivator for me to take this on was the 
        opportunity to learn node.js and to gain a lower level understanding of how web requests work 
        and how packets are transfered (TCP vs UDP, etc).
        </p>      
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding npm, implementing websockets, and designing the gameplay have been the largest
        challenges so far. Balancing this game with my other proiects/school/co-op has also been 
        difficult. I coded in the websocket connections to a node server that I pushed onto a 
         <a href="https://ngrok.com/" class="color2">ngrok server</a> to make sure it would work on 
        multiple devices.
      </br> </br>
        As of now, I need to decide how users will encounter/discover each other, and to implement the main
        fighting mechanics. I also still need to choose sprites for the players and background; 
        which is why there aren't any pictures of the project on this page yet.
      </p>
      <h2>Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Front-end web was definitely easier to learn, but back-end isn't quite as complex as 
        I was expecting. Package managers are very useful, and I used the skills I learned 
        from coding the backend on this project to help my contribution to design teams on campus.
